# Kidino's Codeigniter Base Project

This is my personal base for starting a Codeigniter project. It is still a work-in-progress. You are free to use and propose changes.

Some features:

* Bootstrap 3.0
* Tank Auth views now integrated with Bootstrap 3.0
* Codeigniter 3.0
* DRY with Public_Controller & Admin_Controller
* extended form_helper with ```form_template()``` function to manage Bootstrap form group
